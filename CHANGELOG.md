All notable changes to Pantin. The format follows
[Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) and versions follow
[SemVer](https://semver.org/). Branches and releases: ADR 0044.

## Unreleased

### Added

- Phase 6, in progress (ADR 0043): schema version 12 with belts, guides,
  emitters, absorbers and presence sensors; the Rapier physics engine in the
  core; products carried by belts driven through the drive, motor and drum
  chain; photoelectric presence sensors; the automated phase 6 exit test.
- Phase 6 HTTP API (ADR 0043 point 12): create, replace and delete routes for
  `belts`, `guides`, `emitters`, `absorbers` and `presence-sensors`, with
  conflicts that name the bodies and drum joints in use; `POST .../reset`,
  which clears products, commands and faults but keeps unsaved edits, the
  clock and the step count; and `products` in the pose response and the pose
  stream, so that a product moving on a stopped machine is sent.
- Joint axis from a picked face (ADR 0041) and the assembly frame trihedron
  with a local or global gizmo (ADR 0042).
- One inspector for properties and positioning (ADR 0039) and nested
  assemblies following the STEP tree (ADR 0040).

### Fixed

- The CI workflow now runs on pushes to `develop` and `master`; it watched a
  `main` branch that does not exist.
